Problem Statement:
You are a database administrator. You want to use the data to answer a few
questions about your customers, especially about the sales and profit coming
from different states, money spent in marketing and various other factors such as
COGS, budget profit etc. You plan on using these insights to help find out which
items are being sold the most. Additionally you need help to generate some basic
datasets so your team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.
You have been provided with the sample of the overall customer data due to
privacy issues. But you hope that these samples are enough for you to write fully
functioning SQL queries to help answer the questions.

Dataset:
The 3 key datasets for this case study:
a. FactTable: The FactTable has 13 columns mentioned below and 4200
rows. Profit, Margin, Sales, COGS, Total Expenses, Marketing, Inventory,
Budget, Profit, Budget COGS, Budget Margin, Budget Sales, Area Code,
and ProductID
Note: COGS stands for Cost of Goods Sold

b. ProductTable: The ProductTable has four columns named Product Type,
Product, ProductID, and Type. It has 13 rows which can be broken down
into further details to retrieve the information mentioned in the FactTable.

c. LocationTable: Finally, the LocationTable has 156 rows and follows a
similar approach to ProductTable. It has four columns named Area Code,
State, Market, and Market Size.
