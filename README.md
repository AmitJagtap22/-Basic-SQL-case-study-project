Problem Statement:
You are a database administrator. You want to use the data to answer a few questions about your customers, especially about the sales and profit coming from different states, money spent in marketing and various other 
factors such as COGS, budget profit etc. You plan on using these insights to help find out which items are being sold the most. Additionally you need help to generate some basic datasets so your team can easily inspect the 
data without needing to use SQL. You have been provided with the sample of the overall customer data due to privacy issues. But you hope that these samples are enough for you to write fully functioning SQL queries to help 
answer the questions.
